Ingest .nessus files from Tenable's Nessus scanner  into Elasticsearch.

#### ‚ùî Why the new repo?
This project has taken on it's own form due to the major changes from the original work: [iwikmai/Nessus-ES](https://github.com/iwikmai/Nessus-ES). A huge thanks to the original creator of Nessus-ES as it has given me the foundation to begin learning how to ingest data into the Elastic stack programmatically. Thank you! 

The old project that I had forked and made my changes to is now archived/read-only and may eventually be deleted [nicpenning/Nessus-ES](https://github.com/nicpenning/Nessus-ES). 

This new project comes with some new changes such as bug fixes, pipeline/mapping updates, and the new ability to do a patch summary from previously ingested Nessus scan data that contain the same hosts.

#### ‚ö°Power-Nessieü¶ï
A way to ingest Nessus Scan data into Elasticsearch using PowerShell. Tracking vulnerabilities can be scary and overwhelming but this tool is designed to wrangle up those vulnerabilities into a manageable way.

As always, feel free to post issues / questions in this project to make it even better. Enjoy!

With some careful setup of your Elastic stack and a little PowerShell you can turn your .nessus files into this:
