💫 This is an overview of what you can do with this project along with more details and use cases for using Power-Nessie.

## 🛠️ Requirements
1. Get Nessus API Keys [Nessus Documentation](https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/GenerateAnAPIKey.htm).
2. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/nicpenning/Power-Nessie/releases/latest) and extract to a directory of your choosing.
- Alternatively, to use the latest branch, clone this project to the directory of your choosing: 
```PowerShell
git clone https://github.com/nicpenning/Power-Nessie.git
```
3. Setup Elasticsearch : Step by step instruction 👉🏻 [Option 0](./Option-0.md)
4. Run the Invoke-Power-Nessie.ps1 script supplying required variables for your use case and using the guided options.
5. Watch the Nessus files get downloaded and then ingested into Elasticsearch - Resolve any issues along the way / Ask questions [here](https://github.com/nicpenning/Power-Nessie/discussions).

To fully automate the ingestion on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule you could create a scheduled task to have the Invoke-Power-Nessie.ps1 script kick off as needed.

## 📃 Options
Invoking this script provides an assortment of menu options you can use for your use case!

⚙️This script uses inline variables or a config file. See [Configuration-Priority](https://github.com/nicpenning/Power-Nessie/blob/main/documentation/Configuration-Priority.md) for more details.

### 0️⃣ **Setup Elasticsearch and Kibana.**

Configures your Elastic stack (Elasticsearch & Kibana) to properly ingest and visualize Nessus scan data prior to importing scans. This is a critical first step to ensure your vulnerability data is ready for analysis and reporting.

[Full documentation and use cases here.](./documenation/Option-0.md)

### 1️⃣ **Export Nessus Files.**

Automates the extraction of Nessus scan files from your Nessus scanner and moves them to a local directory for further processing or archival. Optionally, the exported scans can be moved to an archive folder within Nessus.

[Full documentation and use cases here.](./documenation/Option-1.md)

### 2️⃣ **Ingest a Single Nessus File into Elasticsearch (Optional - Patch Summarization upon Completion)**

Imports a single Nessus `.nessus` XML file into your Elasticsearch cluster, making vulnerability data immediately searchable and visualizable in Kibana. Optionally, you can enable Patch Summarization to compare scan results and highlight remediated vulnerabilities.

[Full documentation and use cases here.](./documenation/Option-2.md)

### 3️⃣ **Ingest All Nessus Files from a Specified Directory into Elasticsearch (Optional - Patch Summarization upon Completion)**

Automates the bulk ingestion of all unprocessed Nessus `.nessus` files from a specified directory into your Elasticsearch cluster. Optionally, you can enable Patch Summarization to compare scan results and highlight remediated vulnerabilities.

[Full documentation and use cases here.](./documenation/Option-3.md)

### 4️⃣ **Export and Ingest Nessus Files into Elasticsearch (Optional - Patch Summarization upon Completion)**

Performs a full end-to-end workflow by exporting Nessus scan files from your Nessus scanner, saving them locally, and then ingesting them into Elasticsearch for analysis and visualization.

[Full documentation and use cases here.](./documenation/Option-4.md)

### 5️⃣ **Purge Processed Hashes List**

Removes the list of hashes that track which Nessus files have already been ingested by Power-Nessie. This "reset" option enables reprocessing and re-ingesting of previously imported `.nessus` files.

[Full documentation and use cases here.](./documenation/Option-5.md)

### 6️⃣ **Compare Scan Data Between Scans and Export Results into Elasticsearch (Patch Summarization)**

Compares vulnerability data between two or more Nessus scans and exports the results into Elasticsearch. This option is designed for Patch Summarization.

[Full documentation and use cases here.](./documenation/Option-6.md)

### 7️⃣ **Export PDF or CSV Report from Kibana Dashboard and Optionally Send via Email**

Automates the export of PDF or CSV reports from your Kibana dashboards, allowing you to generate and distribute visualizations of vulnerability data.

[Full documentation and use cases here.](./documenation/Option-7.md)

### 8️⃣ **Remove Processed Scans from Local Nessus File Download Directory**

Automates the cleanup of processed Nessus scan files from your local download directory by removing files marked as ingested.

[Full documentation and use cases here.](./documenation/Option-8.md)

### 🔟 **Delete Oldest Scan from Scan History (Nessus Manager License Only)**

Removes the oldest scan from the scan history for a specified scan name in your Nessus Manager environment.

[Full documentation and use cases here.](./documenation/Option-10.md)

### 🚫 **Quit**

Exits the Power-Nessie script interface.

## 🎉 Conclusion & Workflow Guidance

Power-Nessie provides a robust, modular toolkit for integrating Nessus vulnerability scans with the Elastic Stack using PowerShell. Each menu option is designed to support a specific part of your vulnerability management or compliance workflow — from initial environment setup, to scan export and ingest, to reporting and cleanup.

### Quick Reference: Workflow Steps

1. **Setup Elasticsearch & Kibana**  
   Prepare your analysis environment (Option 0).

2. **Export Nessus Files**  
   Download scans from your Nessus scanner (Option 1).

3. **Ingest Nessus Files**  
   Import scan data into Elasticsearch, either individually (Option 2) or in bulk (Option 3).

4. **Export & Ingest Combined**  
   Automate full-cycle workflows (Option 4).

5. **Manage Ingestion State**  
   Purge processed hashes to reset ingestion (Option 5).

6. **Patch Summarization**  
   Compare scan cycles and summarize vulnerability changes (Option 6).

7. **Report Generation & Delivery**  
   Export PDF/CSV reports from Kibana and distribute via email (Option 7).

8. **Cleanup Processed Scans**  
   Remove old processed files to keep your environment tidy (Option 8).

10. **Manage Scan Retention**  
    Delete oldest scan history entries (Nessus Manager only, Option 10).

Q. **Quit**  
   End your session.
